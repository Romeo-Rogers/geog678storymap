                <h2>The Landsat Program</h2>
                <p>Landsat shows us Earth from space. The Landsat program is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of satellite imagery of Earth.
                  On July 23, 1972 the Earth Resources Technology Satellite was launched. This was eventually renamed to Landsat. The most recent (Landsat 8)
                  was launched on February 11, 2013. The instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images archived in the United
                  States and at Landsat receiving stations around the world are a unique resource for global change research and applications in agriculture,
                  cartography, geology, forestry, regional planning, surveillance, and education. The data can be viewed through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
                  'EarthExplorer' website. Landsat images are usually divided into scenes for easy downloading. Each Landsat scene is about 115 miles long and 115 miles
                  wide (or 100 nautical miles long and 100 nautical miles wide or 185 kilometers long and 185 kilometers wide).</p>
                  <center><img src="img/landsat.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat"></center><hr>
                <p>Landsat data have contributed to our understanding of the Earth in innumerable ways — from measuring the speed of Antarctic glaciers, to tracking water
                  use in crop fields in the Western United States, and to monitoring deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The usefulness of the data stems from a variety
                  of factors engineered into the satellite and the mission project.</p>

            <section data-scene="landsat1">
                <h2>Landsat 1</h2>
                <p>Landsat, originally named "Earth Resources Technology Satellite" with label "1" or "A", was the first satellite of the United States' Landsat program.
                  It was a modified version of the Nimbus 4 meteorological satellite and was launched on July 23, 1972 by a Delta 900 rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base
                  in California. The near-polar orbiting spacecraft served as a stabilized, Earth-oriented platform for obtaining information on agricultural and forestry
                  resources, geology and mineral resources, hydrology and water resources, geography, cartography, environmental pollution, oceanography and marine resources,
                  and meteorological phenomena.</p>
                  <center><img src="img/landsat1.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat1"></center><hr>
                  <p>Landsat 1 had two sensors to achieve its primary objectives: the return beam vidicon (RBV) and the multispectral scanner (MSS).</p>
                  <p>The RBV was manufactured by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). The RBV obtained visible light and near infrared photographic images of Earth.
                    At launch, the RBV was considered the primary sensor.</p>
                  <p>The MSS was manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company. The sensor was considered an experimental sensor, and was the secondary sensor, until scientists
                    reviewed the data that was beamed back to Earth. After the data was reviewed, the MSS was considered the primary sensor. The MSS was a four-channel scanner
                    that obtained radiometric images of Earth.</p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="landsat2">
                <h2>Landsat 2</h2>
                <p>Landsat 2 is the second satellite of the Landsat program. The spacecraft originally carried "Earth Resource Technology Satellite B" designation but was
                  renamed "Landsat 2" prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. The objective of the satellite was to acquire global, seasonal data in medium resolution
                  from a nearto polar sun-synchronous orbit. The satellite (built by General Electric) acquired data with the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multispectral
                  Scanner (MSS). Despite having a design life of one year, Landsat 2 operated for over seven years, finally ceasing operations on February 25, 1982.</p>
                  <center><img src="img/landsat2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat 2"></center><hr>
                <p>As in the case of its predecessor, Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments - the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the
                  Multispectral Scanner (MSS). The scene size (area surveyed by the sensors per scan)for the scanners of the MSS was 170 kilometers (110 mi) to 185 km (115 mi).
                  The ground sampling interval of the MSS was 57 m (187 ft) to 79 m (259 ft)The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data
                  returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.</p>
                <p>The MSS was built by Hughes Aircraft Corporation. It was capable of detecting four different spectral bands: band 4 (visible green), band 5 (visible red),
                  band 6 (near infrared), and band 7 (near infrared).</p>
                <p>Each spectral band had different scientific uses. Band 4 primarily investigated areas of water with the ability to detect sediment laden and shallow water areas.
                  Band 5 was primarily used to identify cultural features. Band 6 sensed the vegetation boundaries between land, water, and landforms. Band 7 was the most proficient
                  at sensing through atmospheric haze, and identified water and land boundaries, vegetation, and landforms.</p>

            <section data-scene="landsat3">
                <h2>Landsat 3</h2>
                <p>Landsat 3 is the third satellite of the Landsat program. It was launched on March 5, 1978, with the primary goal of providing a global archive of satellite
                  imagery.</p>
                <p>Unlike later Landsat satellites, Landsat 3 was managed solely by NASA. Landsat 3 decommissioned on September 7, 1983, beyond its design life of one year.
                  The data collected during its lifetime were used by 31 countries. Countries that cannot afford their own satellite were able to use the data for ecological
                  preservation efforts and to determine the location of natural resources.</p>
                  <center><img src="img/landsat3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat3"></center><hr>
                <p>Landsat 3 carried a Multispectral Scanner (MSS), built by Hughes Aircraft Corporation, and the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) sensors. The MSS had a maximum 75
                  meters (246 ft) resolution. The primary mission of the MSS was to obtain data for agriculture, forestry, geology, and hydrology, but the MSS could also collect
                  information for oceanography and meteorology purposes. Unlike Landsat 1 and 2 missions, Landsat 3 carried a thermal band, but the instrument failed shortly after
                  the satellite was deployed on July 11, 1978.</p>
                  <p>The MSS had five spectral bands - one spectral band more than Landsat 1 and 2. Band 4 primarily investigated water areas. It had the ability to detect sediment
                  laden and shallow water areas. Band 5 was primarily used to identify cultural features. Band 6 sensed vegetation boundaries between land, water, and landforms.
                  Band 7 was most proficient at sensing through atmospheric haze, water and land boundaries, vegetation, and landforms.</p>
                <p>MSS scene size was 170 kilometers (110 mi) to 185 km (115 mi) and had ground sampling interval of 57 m (187 ft) to 79 m (259 ft).</p>

                <h2>Landsat 5</h2>
                <p>Landsat 5 was a low Earth orbit satellite launched on March 1, 1984 to collect imagery of the surface of Earth. It was a continuation of the Landsat Program.
                  Landsat 5 was jointly managed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Data from Landsat 5 was collected
                  and distributed from the USGS's Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS).</p>
                <p>After 29 years in space, Landsat 5 was officially decommissioned on June 5, 2013. Near the end of its mission, its use was hampered by equipment failures and it
                  was largely superseded by Landsat 7 and Landsat 8. Mission scientists anticipated the satellite will re-enter Earth's atmosphere and disintegrate around 2034.</p>
                <p>Landsat 5 was recognized by Guinness World Records as the longest-operating Earth-observing satellite mission in history. Landsat 5 orbited the planet more than 150,000
                  times while transmitting more than 2.5 million images of land surface conditions around the world. I greatly outlived its original three-year design life span.</p>
                <center><img src="img/landsat5.jfif" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat5"></center><hr>
                <p>Landsat 5 was an identical copy of Landsat 4 and was originally intended as a backup. It was deployed at an altitude of 705.3 km (438.3 mi) and it took about 16
                  days to scan the entire Earth. It had a maximum transmission bandwidth of 85 Mbit/s. The Multi-Spectral Scanner was powered down in 1995 but reactivated again in
                  2012.</p>

                <p>Landsat 6 is equipped with upgraded versions of the instruments on Landsat 5 and was designed to carry forward the Landsat program. It was launched on October 5, 1993
                  with a Titan II launch vehicle, <b>but failed to reach orbit</b>.</p>
                <p>Landsat 6 omitted the Multi-Spectral Scanner, found on its predecessors, but carried an Enhanced Thematic Mapper which improved on the previous Thematic Mapper by
                  adding a 15 m - resolution panchromatic band.</p>

                <p>The Enhanced Thematic Mapper was designed and manufactured by Santa Barbara Research Center. The satellite was stabilized to 0.1 degrees in all three axes by using
                  reaction wheels.</p>

                <h2>Landsat 7</h2>
                <p>Landsat 7 is the seventh satellite of the Landsat program. It was Launched on April 15, 1999. Its primary goal is to refresh the global archive of satellite
                  photos, providing up-to-date and cloud-free images. The Landsat Program is managed and operated by the USGS and data from Landsat 7 are collected and distributed
                  by the USGS. The satellite's companion, Earth Observing-1, trailed by one minute and followed the same orbital characteristics. In 2011, EO-1's fuel was depleted
                  and its orbit began to degrade.</p>
                <p>Landsat 7 was built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company.</p>
                <p>In 2016, NASA announced plans to attempt the first ever refueling of a live satellite by refueling Landsat 7 in 2020 with the Restore-L Mission. As of 2019 the
                  date slipped to 2022.</p>
                <center><img src="img/landsat7.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat7"></center><hr>
                <p>Landsat 7 carries the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) senssor. The sensor collects data in seven spectral bands. Band 1 (visible blue), band 2 (visible green),
                  band 3 (visible red), band 4 (near infrared), band 5 (shortwave infrared 1), band 6 (thermal infrared), band 7 (shortwave infrared 2), and band 8 (panchromatic).
                  All the spectral bands have a spatial resolution of 30 m, except band 6 with 60 m (resampled to 30 m) and panchromatic band with 15 m spatial reolution.</p>
                <p>Landsat 7 was designed to last for five years and has the capacity to collect and transmit up to 532 images per day. It is in a polar sun-synchronous orbit
                  (scans across entire Earth's surface) at an altitude of 705 km. It has a remporal resolution of 232 orbits or 16 days.</p>
                <p>Unlike its predecessors, Landsat 7 has a solid state memory of 378 gigabits (roughly 100 images).</p>

                <h2>Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager - OLI)</h2>
                <p>Landsat 8 is an American Earth observation satellite launched on February 11, 2013. It is the eighth satellite in the Landsat program; the seventh to reach
                  orbit successfully. Originally called the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), it is a collaboration between NASA and the United States Geological Survey
                  (USGS). NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provided development, mission systems engineering, and acquisition of the launch vehicle
                  while the USGS provided for development of the ground systems and will conduct on-going mission operations.</p>
                <p>The satellite was built by Orbital Sciences Corporation, who served as prime contractor for the mission. The spacecraft's instruments were constructed by
                  Ball Aerospace and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The launch was contracted to United Launch Alliance. During the first 108 days in orbit, LDCM underwent
                  checkout and verification by NASA and on 30 May 2013, operations were transferred from NASA to the USGS when LDCM was officially renamed to Landsat 8.</p>
                <center><img src="img/landsat8.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image" alt-text="Landsat8"></center><hr>
                <p>The OLI instrument uses a pushbroom sensor instead of whiskbroom sensors that were utilized on earlier Landsat satellites. The pushbroom sensor aligns the imaging
                  detector arrays along its focal plane, allowing a view swath of 115 miles (185 km) cross-track field of view - opposed to sweeping across field of view. With over
                  7,000 detectors per spectral band, the pushbroom design results in increased sensitivity, fewer moving parts, and improved land surface information.
                <p>OLI collects data from nine spectral bands. Seven of the nine bands are consistent with the Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors
                  found on earlier Landsat satellites - providing compatibility with historical Landsat data while also improving measurement capabilities. The two new spectral bands,
                  a deep blue coastal/aerosol band (band 1) and a shortwave-infrared cirrus band (band 9) allow scientists to measure water quality and improve detection of high
                  thin clouds.</p>

                    <p>This story map describes the Landsat program. Landsat program is jointly managed by NASA
                      (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and USGS (United States Geological Survey).
                      It is the longest continuous space-based record of the Earth's land in existence. Every day,
                      Landsat satellites provide essential information to help land managers and policy makers make
                      decisions about our resources and environment.</p>
